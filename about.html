        <p>Pretty Nails Studio is a small but passionate nail extension shop dedicated to creating beautiful, stylish, and confidence-boosting nails for every client. Our studio focuses on soft, feminine, and aesthetic designs that match your personality and everyday lifestyle.

We believe that nails are more than decoration, they are a form of self-expression. That’s why we take our time to understand your preferred style, favorite colors, and nail shape before starting any service. Every set we create is made with care, precision, and a touch of creativity to bring out your unique charm.

At Pretty Nails Studio, we use high-quality materials and safe application techniques to ensure your nails stay strong, long-lasting, and comfortable. Our goal is not only to give you pretty nails, but to also make sure your experience is relaxing, hygienic, and enjoyable from start to finish.

Our studio continues to learn new trends, designs, and techniques to offer a wide range of choices, from soft pink gel nails, classy French tips, and elegant acrylics, to kawaii styles and glittery custom art. We want every client to feel pampered and inspired whenever they see their freshly done extensions.

Pretty Nails Studio is more than a place for nail services; it is a space where you can unwind, express yourself, and feel more beautiful. Our mission is to make every visit special, and our vision is to be a trusted nail studio known for creativity, quality, and girly aesthetic charm.</p>
