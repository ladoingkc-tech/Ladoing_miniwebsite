1. Gel Nail Extensions

Soft, lightweight, and glossy nail extensions that are long-lasting and elegant. Perfect for everyday wear or special occasions.
</p>
<p>Gel nail extensions are artificial nails made using a special gel formula that helps create longer, stronger, and more beautiful nails. The gel is applied over a nail form or tip, shaped to the desired length, and then cured under a UV or LED lamp to harden it. These extensions feel lighter and more natural compared to acrylic nails, which makes them a popular choice. They also provide a glossy, smooth finish that can be customized with different colors, shapes, and designs. Gel extensions can last for weeks with proper care and are known to be less damaging to natural nails. Overall, they are a great option for anyone who wants durable, stylish, and natural-looking nails.</p>

2. Acrylic Nail Extensions

Durable and versatile nails ideal for longer lengths and bold designs. Choose from classic, chic, or creative styles.
</p>
<p>Acrylic nail extensions are artificial nails made by combining a liquid monomer and a powder polymer to create a hard protective layer over the natural nail. They are used to add length, strength, and shape to the nails. The mixture quickly hardens when exposed to air, forming a solid extension. Acrylics are known for their durability and ability to last for weeks. They can be customized with different shapes and designs. They are commonly used in salons as a reliable method for enhancing nail appearance. Acrylic nail extensions also provide a firm surface that supports nail art. Even though they are strong, they should be applied and removed properly to protect the natural nails. Overall, acrylic nail extensions are a widely used technique for creating long-lasting artificial nails.</p>
